</p>
Ice country, a flock of sheeps are wearing hawaiian shirts. It is intriging. You just cannot resist to boop the sheep, but be careful some electric sheeps are hidden through the harmless cozy cool caprinaes, and they are up to no good.

# Environment
Boop the sheep features two worlds. The ice world of hawaiian shirts sheeps, and the tropical world of leather jacket sheeps. They are both similar with random electric sheep that will buzz you. After 5 buzz you will automatically change world. The non electrical sheeps will just jump out of the screen when clicked.

# Goal
Boop all the sheeps.

# Tools
Using canvas for the web app.
